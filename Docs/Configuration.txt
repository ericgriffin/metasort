A valid metasort configuration file contains these four sections:

folders
{
...
}

extensions
{
...
}

config
{
...
}

rules
{
...
}


SECTION DESCRIPTIONS

folders

	The folders section specifies one or more paths which should be searched by metasort. 
	Each path should be on its own line.
	All backslashes (\) should be entered as forward-slashes (/), and there should be a forward slash at the end of each folder path. 
	Paths with spaces should be enclosed in quotation marks ("").
	SAMBA/CIFS/UNC paths should have "//" before the server name.
	An 'R' after a folder path designates that the path should be searched recursively.
	
	Example:

		Metasort will search the following 3 folders. The last two UNC paths will be searched recursively:

		folders
		{
			c:/folder/
			//smbserver/folder/subfolder/ R
			"//smbserver/folder a/sub folder/" R
		}



extensions

	The extensions section specifies which file extensions should be scanned by metasort.
	Any file extension which is not specified in this section will be ignored by metasort.
	Each extension should be on its own line.
	Each extension should include a '.' before the characters.
	Regular expressions can be used by prefixing the extension pattern with '[REGEX]'.

	Examples:

		Metasort will only search files with a .mpg or .mpeg extension:

		extensions
		{
			.mpg
			.mpeg
		}


		Metasort will search files with any extension:

		extensions
		{
			[REGEX].*
		}

		Metasort will search files with any extension beginning with 'm':

		extensions
		{
			[REGEX].m*
		}



config

	The config section contains configuration parameters that are used by metasort.
	If optional parameters are omitted then the default system value is used.
	Each parameter should be on its own line.
	All backslashes (\) should be entered as forward-slashes (/).
	Paths with spaces should be enclosed in quotation marks ("").

	Required parameters:

		logfile [path_to_logfile]

			- specifies the file used for logging.

	Optional parameters:

		file_inspection_time [time_in_milliseconds]

			- specifies the period of time each file is examined for changes before performing an action on the file.
			- default value is 20000 (20 seconds).


	Examples:

		Metasort will log to the following file:

		config
		{
			logfile c:/metasort/metasort.log 
		}


		Metasort will log to the specified file on the network, and examine each file for changes for 30 seconds before performing an action:

		config
		{
			logfile "//smbserver/log files/metasort.log"
			file_inspection_time 30000
		}


rules

	The rules section contains one or more rules which specify an action to perform on a file when a set of conditions is met.

	This is the general syntax for a rule:

		rulename_action actionparameter
	 	{
			streamtype_streamnumber
			{
				parameter parametervalue
				...
			}
			...
		}


	rulename
		rulename is used to identify and describe a rule.
		This can be any combination of alphanumeric characters.
		No spaces or underscores allowed.
		Each rulename must be unique in the configuration file.
		

	action 
		This is the action to perform when the conditions of the rule are met.
		The action can be one of the following:

			list
				- writes the filename to a new line in the text file specified by the actionparameter.
				- actionparameter is a destination file.

			move
				- moves a file safely by first copying to the destination path specified by the actionparameter and then deleting the source.
				- actionparameter is a destination path.
			
			fastmove
				- moves a file to the destination path specified by the actionparameter quickly using the rename system call.
				- actionparameter is a destination path.

			copy
				- copies a file to the destination path specified by the actionparameter.
				- actionparameter is a destination path.

			copyonce
				- copies a file to the destination path specified by the actionparameter.
				- a history of the copy transaction is kept, and any subsequent files in the same source folder with the same name and size will not be copied. If a file with the same name subsequently appears in the source folder, but is deemed to be a different file via size or contents, then that new file will be copied and its history recorded.
				- actionparameter is a destination path.

			exec
				- executes a system command specified by the actionparameter. The variable %s represents the filename matching the rule conditions and can be used as a command-line parameter.
				- actionparameter is a command-line command.

			delete
				- deletes a file. As a safety precaution the actionparameter must be set to "IAMSURE" for this action to be enabled.
				- actionparameter is "IAMSURE".

			copyonceCUSTOM1
				- same as copyonce, but capitalizes all characters in the destination filename and removes all spaces, dashes and underscores from the destination filename.
				- actionparameter is a destination path.


		Examples:

			Metasort will move the files to c:/destination/:

			Rule1_move "c:/destination/"
			{...}

			Metasort will open the file with the VLC executable

			Rule2_exec "\"C:/Program Files (x86)/VideoLAN/VLC/vlc.exe\" %s"
			{...}


	actionparameter
		This value is used by the action and its format/value is specific to each type of action. See the description of an action to determine what the value of actionparameter should be.
		All backslashes (\) should be entered as forward-slashes (/).
		If the value is a path (used in list, move, copy, etc.), then there should be a forward slash at the end of each path (/).
		Values with spaces (paths or system commands) should be enclosed in quotation marks ("").


	streamtype
		streamtype specifies what type of metadata is to be evaluated by the parameters within the streamtype_streamnumber section. In other words, what type of stream is going to be evaluated. If streamtype_streamnumber is 'video_1', then the parameters within that section will be evaluated against the first video stream in the file. If streamtype_streamnumber is 'audio_4', then the parameters within that section will be evaluated against the 4th audio stream in the file.
		streamtype 'general' is used for filesystem metadata and multimedia parameters which are not particular to an individual stream (ex. audio_layout).
		
		Possible values for streamtype are:
			general
			audio
			video
			text
			other
			image
			menu


	streamnumber
		streamnumber specifies the stream number to be evaluated by the parameters within the streamtype_streamnumber section.
		It is a single numeric value (1, 2, 3, ...).
		For streamtype general, streamnumber '0' is the only valid option.


	parameter
		parameter is a file attribute or metadata attribute which is evaluated for a particular file. If a file's value for a specified parameter matches the conditions in parametervalue, then the parameter is said to have "matched" for the given file. If all parameters in a rule match for a particular file, then the rule's action is executed.

		parameter can be any MediaInfo parameter. See "MediaInfo Parameters" folder for a complete list.
		
		parameter can also be any of these parameters in the general_0 stream:

			audio_layout [layout]
				- Each digit in layout represents an audio stream, the lowest stream being the left-most digit. The value of each digit is the number of channels in the stream.
				- For example, "audio_layout 22" would catch any files which had 2 channels in the first stream, and 2 channels in the second stream. 'audio_layout 11111111' would catch any files which had 1 channel in all 8 streams.
				
			file_size [size in KB]
				- catches files whose size is represented by the field in Kilobytes.
				
				
			file_create_age [minutes]
				- catches files where the difference between the current time and the file's created time matches the field specified in minutes.
				
			file_modified_age [minutes]
				- catches files where the difference between the current time and the file's modified date matches the field specified in minutes.

			file_create_date [YYYYMMDD]
				- catches files whose created date matches the field specifying a date in ISO format.
				
			file_modified_date [YYYYMMDD]
				- catches files whose modified date matches the field specifying a date in ISO format.
					
			file_name [filename]
				- catches files whose filename matches the name specified in the field.

			file_extension [.extension]
				- catches files whose extension matches the extension specified in the field.

			file_path [path]
				- catches files whose file path matches the path specified in the field. This path does not include the acutal file name, just the pathe before it.

		All parameter values can be expressed as regular expressions by prefixing them with '[REGEX]'. Ex. 'audio_layout [REGEX]2...'' or 'file_name [REGEX].*HD.*'


	parametervalue
		- parametervalue is a value against which the file's value for a given parameter is compared.
		- the value/format of parametervalue is unique to each type of parameter. See the description of each parameter to determine what parametervalue should be. 
		- parametervalue's can be prefixed with these conditional operators where applicable:
			'!' sets parameter as an exclusion.
			'<' signifies less-than.
			'>' signifies greater-than.
			'[REGEX]' signifies a regular expression.
